# Insufficient workflow validation

## target

buy items for an unintended price

## purchase flow

1. Choose Quantity & Add Item.
2. (maybe add coupon) & Place order.
3. Order-confirmation.

## vul

- place order(2) & order-confirmation(3) function
- the dev assume that user will come to (3) then (3). That the credit have already checked in (2), and in (3) didn't check it.

## exploit

- Go (1) -> (3): Done
