# Excessive trust in client-side controls

## target

buy items for an unintended price

## vul

- add to cart function
- in item detail page, the price is embedded in client-side and attach to request.

## exploit

- at first, with the hint of the lab "*an unintended price*" I try to change the price in cart page.But it doesn't work.
- I try to define the attack vector, enum each of them. After that I find that *in item detail page, the price is embedded in client-side and attach to request.*
  -> edit the price in request to 1$ and buy.
