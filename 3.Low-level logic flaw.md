# Low-level logic flaw

## target

buy items for an unintended price

## vul

- add to cart function
- max item each time was defined be 99, but max item quantity not defined and verify.
- MAX + 1 = - MAX (in binary)

## exploit

- call API to add 99 multiple time
- the cart money will come from 0 -> MAX -> -MAX -> 0 -> small number that we can charge.
